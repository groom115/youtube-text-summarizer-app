# youtube-text-summarizer-app

# Overview:

Every day people spend hours watching Youtube videos, and not always we feel it worth watching, but they do not realize it immediately, maybe only after 10, 20 minutes, sometimes, and it basically wasting our time. 
Since I am a frequent Youtube user I've thought about something that could solve this problem. Therefore for my final project, I created a  Youtube video transcript summarizer with  NLP. It summarizes the content of youtube according to ur desired sizes.
